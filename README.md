# Summer Practice
C4.5 algorithm

The main file is main_test.py. To run it you need to write python3 main_test.py <key> < input_<number>.txt in command line,
where <key> - optional parameter. 
It could be '-s', if you want to see only results of standart version C4.5. 
It could also be '-c', if you need to watch only results of improved version.
Also you can leave <key> empty or type 'all'. In this case program will return both results.
